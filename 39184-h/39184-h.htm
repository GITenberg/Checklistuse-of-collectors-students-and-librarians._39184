<h1>editorial</h1>

<h4>THE PURPOSE AND HISTORY OF THE CHECKLIST</h4>

<p>Here, in a single volume, it has been our intention to
list, document and review every novel dealing, however slightly,
with female variance, lesbianism or intense emotional relationships
between women. We have also included a majority of the
better known novels which, dealing primarily with male homosexuality,
are of interest to the collector of variant fiction in
general.</p>

<p>In related supplements we have compiled lists of variant
poetry, variant films, of the major book services and publishing
houses where these books can be obtained, and of the homosexual
press.</p>

<p>The titles in the major portion of the Checklist are listed
in a single comprehensive index by author. Information includes
date published, number of reprints and publisher&#8217;s name. Brief
reviews are included of most titles. An effort has been made in
each case to distinguish whether the work under discussion is a
novel about lesbianism, whether the variant content has been included
mostly for shock effect, or whether (as in some excellent
modern novels) homosexual characters appear incidentally to the
other main themes of action in the book.</p>

<p>In such a comprehensive listing, reviews must of necessity
be brief. For further discussion of many of the titles listed
here, with excellent and complete critical analysis of their
variant content, the serious student or collector is earnestly
urged to invest in the definitive and major work on the subject:</p>

<p class="indent2b">
FOSTER, Jeannette Howard; <i>Sex Variant Women in
Literature</i>. N. Y. Vantage Press, 1956.
</p>

<p>Although now officially out of print, this book can occasionally
be obtained second hand, and copies will soon be offered for
sale through the Daughters of Bilitis publication, THE LADDER.
(See appendix.) We have made no effort to give more than cursory
reviews of titles which are discussed at length in Dr. Foster&#8217;s
work. However, since the publication of the Foster book, many
new novels of lesbianism have been published, and the diligent
search of many collectors, working with the Checklist editors,
has brought many old ones to light.</p>

<p>We have tried to review in some detail the novels which
were omitted from Dr. Foster&#8217;s work, and to strive for completeness,
even at the expense of discriminatory judgment about the
excellence or otherwise of the works included. Therefore this
Checklist includes many works whose lesbian content was too
slight, too subtle&mdash;or too &#8220;trashy&#8221;&mdash;to have come within the
scope of the scholarly studies of Dr. Foster or the running
column, <i>Lesbiana</i>, conducted by junior editor Gene Damon in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
pages of THE LADDER.</p>

<p>It is our further contention that many novels dealing with
male homosexuality come also within the province of the serious
collector of lesbiana. We make, however, no claim for completeness
for novels which fall within the homosexual, rather than
the lesbian province. In general, the male titles included in
this list&mdash;clearly defined, in each case, by the sign (m)&mdash;have
been included because they were of special interest to
the editors and therefore are presumably of interest to other
collectors of lesbiana.</p>

<p>For those who wish a complete list of works dealing with
male homosexuality, we suggest the comprehensive bibliography
compiled by Noel I. Garde, discussed in the Appendix of Related
Publications. Mr. Garde has indexed virtually every homosexual
work from antiquity to the latest paperback shocker, and has also
performed the mighty task of separating them into categories ...
a task from which the Checklist editors have shrunk, though we
have made some attempt at classification in our reviews and by
awarding a plus sign to books of exceptional value. (For further
discussion of this division, please consult the &#8220;List of Symbols
and Abbreviations&#8221; on page 2.)</p>

<p>Most of the reviews in the present listing were written by
one of the editors; no attempt has been made to divide the reviews
written by MZB from those written by Damon. In general, these
reviews have been gathered from so many sources that the awarding
of individual credit would be impossible.</p>

<p>This Checklist, 1960, is the last of the cumulative Checklists.
Plans at present are to publish brief supplements annually, listing
only new titles, new reprints of old titles, or new discoveries of
overlooked titles. Since this is the case, we feel that some brief
history of the Checklist might be of interest to the readers.</p>

<p>Nearly 10 years ago, in the mailing of the Fantasy Amateur
Press Association, a very bitter discussion was raging on the
subject of censorship&mdash;pro and con. Complicating this discussion,
a man who is now dead, and shall therefore be nameless, published
a scathing attack on homosexuals. By way of subtle reproof, and
partially as a deadpan joke on this man, your senior editor, with
Royal Drummond (whose &#8220;Digression&#8221; was highly praised by Checklist
readers last year ...) published a 12-page offset leaflet, with
editorials attacking censorship, and extensive reviews of perhaps
a dozen of the best known homosexual novels. This leaflet had
a cartoon cover and the general light-hearted tone of the publication
was indicated by the title, which was <i>Fairy Tales for
Fabulous Faps</i>. Reaction to this leaflet was mixed, but in general
the readers enjoyed it, and said, &#8220;Do this again some time&mdash;&#8221;.
However, soon after this, Mr. Drummond dropped out of the Fantasy
Amateur Press Association, and your present editor had no impetus
to continue the series single-handed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span></p>

<p>Early in the history of the publication known as THE LADDER,
your senior editor had the privilege of reviewing the Foster book
mentioned above, while the junior editor was in charge of the
<i>Lesbiana</i> column. After reading the Foster work, your editor (MZB)
resolved to publish a list of the omitted titles; when I began
cutting the mimeograph stencils, however, I resolved to review
not only the titles which Dr. Foster had omitted, but all of those
which I had read, for the purpose of putting into print my own
personal opinions and reactions. This first Checklist was called
<i>Astra&#8217;s Tower #2</i>, and the number 2 seems to have baffled a good
many people&mdash;they all wrote in, inquiring about #1. Number 1,
however, was a mimeographed booklet of my own fiction, published
during my late teens for the FAPA, mentioned above.</p>

<p>Through this first Checklist, I came into contact with Miss
Damon, and because paperback lesbiana was blossoming on all the
stands, we quickly resolved to publish another Checklist. I had
fully intended to give Miss Damon full credit for her work last
year; however, the mimeograph work on last year&#8217;s list was so
poor, the quality of the paper so bad, and some unreliable reviewers
fouled me up so badly on data, that I refused to foist off
any portion of the blame on other shoulders.</p>

<p>The relaxing of censorship of recent years&mdash;as documented
in the Supreme Court judgment relevant to <i>Lady Chatterley&#8217;s Lover</i>,
etc.&mdash;has meant, in recent fiction, fewer taboos and in general
a franker treatment of sexual themes. On the whole this is a good
thing. However and unfortunately, it has also released a flood
of trash and borderline erotica, of no literary worth and
&#8220;interesting&#8221; only for the sexual content. Your editors have
conscientiously waded through all this newsstand slush (and
believe me, we get no kick out of it) because experience has
taught us that even the worst peddlers of commercialized sex-trash
sometimes come up with exceptionally well-written, honest and
sincere work. For instance, Beacon Books (a subsidiary of Universal
Publishing and Distributing Company)&mdash;some of whose
paperback originals can be called printable only by the uttermost
charity,&mdash;are currently also publishing the work of Artemis
Smith, one of the major writers in the variant field today.</p>

<p>However, actually reviewing the majority of this stuff is
impossible. Most of these books are not novels at all. They have
impossibly complex plots&mdash;or no plots at all&mdash;since the story
exists only as an excuse for the characters to jump into amorous
exercise with the closest male, or female, or sometimes both.
This sort of thing, &#8220;lesbian&#8221; only remotely, belongs more properly
to the field of curiosa. One can, of course, display a Place
Pigalle post card in a gallery with the Botticelli Venus, and
classify them both as &#8220;nudes&#8221;. I personally consider this an
insult to the Venus, and the devotee of &#8220;feelthy peectures&#8221; will
find the restraint and taste of fine art too tame for his jaded
tastes.</p>

<p>We are unalterably opposed to most censorship&mdash;but after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
wading through almost a hundred books whose only excuse for
existence is to provide phony &#8220;thrills&#8221; for people too inhibited,
too ignorant or too fearful to provide their own, well&mdash;- we
think wistfully of some self-imposed standards of taste.</p>

<p>We also realize, flatly and realistically, that too much
license in this stuff is going to bring on a wave of public
reaction which may impose a sure-enough censorship&mdash;making the
standards of the 1940s and 1950s look liberal.</p>

<p>Now obviously the field of homosexual literature is going
to place a certain emphasis on the sexual problems of humanity
which will be quantitatively greater than that of&mdash;say&mdash;the
Western novel, or the detective story. Sex alone has not been
made an excuse for consigning any novel to the trashbin. If the
treatment is honest, the characters even remotely believable
and the purpose of the book seems reasonably genuine, then the
quantity of sex is purely a matter for the author&#8217;s discretion;
and be it much, as in the works of March Hastings, Artemis Smith
or Henry Miller, or little, as in Iris Murdoch&#8217;s delicate and
subtle THE BELL, or Shirley Jackson&#8217;s THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE,&mdash;- we
give the book judgment only on its merits as a book.</p>

<p>However, in self-defense, we have had to find a way to dispose
of the more repetitive rubbish. Allowing for differences
in taste, and granting that many people like their books well-spiced,
if there is a reasonably well-written story along with
the sex we have called it &#8220;Evening waster&#8221;&mdash;on the grounds
that it may very well provide pleasant entertainment for anyone
not a hopeless prude. But if the story is just a peg on which
to hang up a lot of poorly written, gamy erotic episodes, with
no literary value, and just evasive enough to keep the printer
out of jail, then we have given it short shrift with the abbreviation
&#8220;scv&#8221;&mdash;which cryptic letters are editorial shorthand
for &#8220;Short Course in Voyeurism&#8221;&mdash;and have been the basis of a
lot of jokes in the tedious business of passing reviews around
the editorial staff (The junior and senior editors live a thousand
miles apart and have never met; the others who occasionally contribute
reviews are scattered from Alabama to Oregon.). So we
have to have some fun in the endless correspondence&mdash;and &#8220;scv&#8221;
books are fair game.</p>

<p>Regrettably, we are well aware that some people are going
to use this designation in precisely the opposite fashion than
we intended&mdash;- go through the list picking out the sexy books
and carefully avoiding the others. Well&mdash;we shan&#8217;t spoil your
fun. Each to her own taste, as the old lady said when she kissed
the cow.</p>

<p>We wish here to give some slight acknowledgment to all
those who, over the years since the initiation of this endeavor,
have contributed overlooked titles, pointed out our errors,
sent comments, criticisms and sometimes cash, laboriously
tracked down elusive data, worked as unpaid researchers and
stencil-cutters, and in general helped us to feel we were not
working in a vacuum.</p>

<p>Special acknowledgments are due to Dr. Jeannette Howard
Foster, unfailingly generous and gracious in allowing us to
pick her brains; to Leslie Laird Winston, of the Winston Book
Service; to the editors of THE LADDER, Del Martin in particular,
for helping us to publicize our Checklist, and for allowing us
to use reviews run in the <i>Lesbiana</i> column; to Forrest Ackerman,
for endless help and encouragement; and to Kerry Dame, whose
generous gift of stamps proved invaluable to the heavy load of
correspondence necessary to keep this one-woman publishing
house rolling. And to all those others, anonymous by choice,
who have sent small gifts of cash and stamps, turned up elusive
paperbacks for me in news-standless West Texas, contributed
reviews and data, and, above all, provided cheer and encouraging
support. We hope this Checklist is half as much fun for you to
read as it was for us&mdash;all things considered&mdash;to prepare.</p>

<p>And here at the end I take off my editorial &#8220;We&#8221; for a
special, personal THANK YOU to my collaborator and co-editor,
GENE DAMON.</p>

<p>And now, until the first Supplement time, it&#8217;s time to
turn the Checklist over to you. Comments and criticisms are
invited.</p>

<h3>THE COMPLETE, CUMULATIVE CHECKLIST
OF LESBIAN FICTION</h3>

<p class="indent">ACKWORTH, ROBERT C. <i>The Moments Between.</i> pbo, Hillman Books 1959.
Characters in a college novel include an instructor&mdash;male&mdash;who
is homosexual, very sympathetically portrayed.
Also a subtle, but sympathetic attachment between an unlovely,
unloved student and an older woman; the relationship is
shown as constructive for both in the end.</p>

studies of the lesbian world, highly subjective, mostly
vignettes of gay life in and around Greenwich Village, with
some added data about the manners, customs and language of
the &#8220;gay&#8221; world. Good reading, if somewhat biased.</p>

passim the story of Sister Helena, novice-mistress; although
her behavior was strictly correct even for a nun, she once

Helena, after her death, as &#8220;the one human being I ever loved&#8221;.</p>

<p class="indent2"><i>I am a Woman.</i> pbo, Gold Medal, 1959.</p>

<p class="indent2"><i>Women in the Shadows.</i> pbo, Gold Medal, 1959.</p>

<p class="indent2">These three
form a single, connected narrative, although any of the
three novels can be read as a self-contained story. The
first volume introduces the heroine of the series, Laura
Landon, at college; where, in undergoing an affair with
her room-mate, lovely but frigid Beth, she discovers her
homosexuality. Softened by the affair, Beth marries, and
Laura runs away. In the second book, Laura, in Greenwich
Village, is sharing an apartment, with Marcie, a divorcee,
entirely &#8220;straight&#8221; who plays Laura along strictly for
kicks; Laura suffers under this treatment for a long time,
then runs away again to shack up with a butch-type Village
character, Beebo. In the third book, Laura and Beebo have
been living together for two years; Laura is tiring of this
lengthy affair and cheats on Beebo with a colored dancer
named Tris, while Beebo, to win Laura back, resorts to
such trickery as staging a phony &#8220;rape&#8221; ... inflicting wounds
on herself in search of sympathy. Tiring of this life,
Laura runs away again, this, time to marry a male homosexual
friend, Jack, in a search for stability and permanence. The
whole story invites comparison with Weiraugh&#8217;s THE SCORPION:
homosexuality per se is not attacked, but the drawbacks
of the life, and the dangers and difficulties to anyone
trying to adjust him-or-herself to that life, are frankly
and brutally delineated; there is a pervasive air of
dissatisfaction, or resignation, and gradual withdrawal;
and the ending of the third book is unsatisfactory and hardly
complete. Nevertheless, the impact of these books, particularly
when read all together, is considerable; Miss Bannon&#8217;s
grasp of character, technique and construction improve with
each novel. Despite wild improbabilities and gimmicky,
contrived situations, these are perhaps the major contribution
to lesbian literature in the paperback field anywhere.</p>

Called a &#8220;Modern Saga&#8221;, this is laid in 18th-Century Iceland.
Two half-brothers, Jason the Red and Michael Sunlocks, sons
of the same man by different mothers, grow up knowing of one
another&#8217;s existence, but unknown to each other personally.
Through a series of saga-like coincidences, they fall in
love with the same woman, and are eventually exiled together
to the sulphur mines&mdash;Iceland&#8217;s prison colony&mdash;still
unaware of each other&#8217;s real identity. There Jason undergoes
a psychological and emotional upheaval which can only be
described as &#8220;falling in love&#8221; with Michael, who is still
known to him only as Prisoner A-25, not as his hated brother.

<p class="indent3">+ CASAL, MARY. <i>The Stone Wall. An Autobiography.</i> Chicago, Eyncourt,
Press, 1930. In casual, conversational and entirely
frank form, a woman born in 1865 (and therefore, at the
time of writing, in her sixties) tells the story of her
entire life as a lesbian. With the exception of &#8220;slightly
autobiographical&#8221;&mdash;and always greatly disguised&mdash;fiction,
this is probably the earliest such memoir in the literature.
The writing is highly competent and professional, (subtly
denying the author&#8217;s insistence that she was not a writer;)
and filled with most interesting revelations about the
lesbian world of New York and Paris at the turn of this
century. Unfortunately the book is rare and expensive, but
it stands alone as a classic of its kind.</p>

<p class="indent">CHEEVER, JOHN. &#8220;Clancy in the Tower of Babel&#8221;, ss in <i>The
Enormous Radio</i>, Funk 1953, pbr Berkley 1958, (m).</p>

<p class="indent3">+ CHRISTIAN, PAULA. <i>The Edge of Twilight.</i> pbo Crest 1959.
Airline stewardess Val, in an alcoholic haze, allows
herself to make love to a young girl friend, Toni. Fearing
her own response to this &#8220;abnormal&#8221; love, she redoubles her
promiscuous sleeping-around, but the girls end up together.
The treatment, though sensational, is honest and constructive;
the book will win no literary prizes, but whatever the
reader&#8217;s sympathies and prejudices, he will approve the
stand that happy adjustment to love and affection&mdash;even
homosexual&mdash;is a more constructive solution than promiscuity.
Very good of its kind.</p>

<p class="indent">CHRISTIE, AGATHA. <i>A Murder is Announced.</i> Dodd, Mead 1950, fco.
Suspects include a pair of problematical lesbians.</p>

<p class="indent">CLARK, DORENE. <i>The Exotic Affair.</i> Magnet Books, 1959, scv.
&#8220;I really think this one should be Maggot Books,&#8221; wrote
my reviewer. &#8220;One of those fastmoving sloppy jobs where
two men and two women on an exotic cruise complete with
mis-spelled and misapplied foreign phrases spend most of
their time trying all of the printable and some of the
unprintable variations on an old old theme. All sex and no
sentiment makes Jack and Jill sickening (and the reviewer
sick) or, for that matter, Jack and Jack or Jill and Jill.&#8221;</p>

<p class="indent3">+ CLAYTON, JOHN. <i>Dew in April.</i> Kendall &amp; Sharpe, 1935.
Romance of the Middle Ages, laid in the Convent of St.
Lazarus of the Butterflies. Dolores, a homeless vagabond,
is given shelter by Mother Leonor, a mystic, repressed, white-hot
and deeply tender woman whose passionate emotional attachments
to her young novices are never explicit but pervade the
entire book. Much of the story is concerned with a subtle,
sweet and innocently sensual blossoming of adolescent emotions
into homo-erotic form under the pressures of convent life;
the interplay of delicate love relationships between Dolores,
Mother Leonor, and the young novices Dezirada and Clarisse,
and their fluctuation between despair, self-sacrifice and
compassionate love when Dolores finds a knightly lover, Pedro,
is probably unmatched in studies of feminine variance.</p>

<p class="indent2"><i>Gold of Toulouse.</i> Kendall &amp; Sharpe, 1935. Sequel to
<i>Dew in April</i>, but laid chronologically six or seven years
earlier. Though mostly concerned with the adventures of Don
Marcos, the Spanish knight, it also tells the story of Leonor,
and shows the beginning of her relationship with Dezirada.</p>

<p class="indent">COLETTE, SIDONIE-GABRIELLE.</p>

<p class="indent2"><i>Claudine at School</i>.</p>

<p class="indent2"><i>Claudine in Paris</i>.</p>

<p class="indent2"><i>The Indulgent Husband</i> (in The Short Novels of Colette).
&#8220;Bella Vista&#8221; in <i>The Tender Shoot</i>.
&#8220;Gitanette&#8221; in <i>Music Hall Sidelights</i>.</p>

<p class="indent2">All of these are
currently in print in excellent, uniform English translation
of the standard &#8220;Fleuron&#8221; edition of Colette&#8217;s complete
works, from Farrar, Straus &amp; Cudahy, of recent date. The
two &#8220;Claudine&#8221; novels have had recent Avon pbr editions
under the titles of <i>Diary of a 15 Year Old French Girl</i>,
and <i>Claudine</i>.</p>

<p class="indent2">Much of the work of this important French
novelist was variant. Only the most explicit are named
above. The first three form a connected narrative, telling
of Claudine&#8217;s school crushes, her friendship with a male-homosexual
cousin, and her &#8220;indulgent husband&#8221; who connives
at her lesbian affair with a woman friend, in order to enjoy
it secondhand. &#8220;Bella Vista&#8221; tells of a vacation spent, at
a hotel managed by two middle-aged lesbians; the narrator&#8217;s
fascinated interest in the couple vanishes when one of the
&#8220;ladies&#8221; turns out to be, actually, a disguised man.</p>

<p class="indent">CONNOLLY, CYRIL. <i>The Rock Pool.</i> Scribner 1936, her New Directions
n. d. Very well written novel of a group of expatriates
in the South of France. Nearly all are homosexuals;
the story is told without comment or judgment.</p>

<p class="indent">CONSTANTINE, MURRAY, and Margaret Goldsmith. <i>Venus in Scorpio.</i>
John Lane, 1940. Heavily fictionalized biography,
(erroneously listed elsewhere as a novel) of Marie
Antoinette, suggesting lesbianism in her adolescence.</p>

<p class="indent3">+ CORY, DONALD WEBSTER. <i>21 Variations on a Theme.</i> N. Y., Greenberg
1953. The classic anthology of short stories about
homosexuals; four deal with feminine variance.</p>

<p class="indent">CRADOCK, PHYLLIS. <i>Gateway to Remembrance.</i> Andrew Dakers, London
1950. fco. Very brief mention of a lesbian couple in
a sappy metaphysical novel about Lost Atlantis.</p>

<p class="indent">CRAIG, JONATHAN. <i>Case of the Village Tramp.</i> pbo Gold Medal 1959.
Fast, well-written mystery introduces a pair of
lesbians among the suspects; <i>good</i> entertainment.</p>

<p class="indent3">+ CRAIGIN, ELISABETH. <i>Either is Love.</i> Harcourt, Brace, 1937, pbr
Lion Books, 1952, 1956, Pyramid 1960. After the death
of her husband the narrator re-reads the letters she had
written him about her intense love affair with another woman.
Almost unequalled treatment of a lesbian <i>romance</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">CREAL, MARGARET. <i>A Lesson in Love.</i> Simon &amp; Schuster 1957.
A Canadian orphan&#8217;s passion for a beautiful schoolmate
ends in disillusion when the older girl, Tammy, tries to
force Nicola into a distasteful affair with a boy, the better
to deceive her mother about a similar affair of her own.</p>

<p class="indent">CROUZAT, HENRI. <i>The Island at the End of the World.</i> Duell, Sloan
and Pearce, 1959. An ex-schoolteacher, Patrice, is
marooned on a sub-Antarctic island with three nurses; Joan,
a nymphomanic; Victoria, a lesbian, and Kathleen, a quite
ordinary girl. Due to fortuitous circumstances, they manage
to assure themselves the necessities of life, and between
Robinson-Crusoe-ish struggles, embark on a round of excesses
gradually diminished by the horrible deaths of Kathleen, then
Victoria. Fascinating, slightly macabre.</p>

<p class="indent3">+ CUSHING, MARY WATKINS. <i>The Rainbow Bridge</i>. G P Putnam&#8217;s Sons,
1954. This book is included for the light it sheds on
another novel in this list, Marcia Davenport&#8217;s <i>Of Lena
Geyer</i>, and not for the sake of any impertinent conclusions
about the real people involved. Mrs. Cushing served for
seven years as companion and buffer against the world for
the famous prima donna, Olive Fremstad, and Mme. Fremstad&#8217;s
reclusive, fantastically disciplined personality seems to
have served, at least in part, as model for Lena Geyer. At
any rate, both books become more interesting when read
together.</p>

<p class="indent">DANE, CLEMENCE. (pseud. of Winifred Ashton); <i>Regiment of Women</i>.
Macmillan, 1917. Possibly the earliest novel of
variance. A lengthy book of the subtle sadism of the domineering
headmistress of a girl&#8217;s school.</p>

<p class="indent">DARIUS, MICHEL. <i>I, Sappho of Lesbos.</i> Castle Books, May 1960.
Supposedly translated from a Medieval Latin manuscript
conveniently lost on the Andrea Doria. In first-person, this
weaves the better-known traditions about Sappho into a racy,
fast-moving novel. The lesbian content is not emphasized,<span class='pagenum2'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
unduly. Writing-wise, this invites comparison with the
work of Pierre Louys. The &#8220;scholarship&#8221; is completely
tongue-in-cheekish, of course, as with the <i>Songs of Bilitis</i>.
In general, this should prove the Title of the Year for
those who wonder why they don&#8217;t write like Pierre Louys
anymore. (Department of Unpaid Advertising; this one can NOW
be ordered through Winston Book Service; see Appendix.)</p>

<p class="indent">DAVENPORT, MARCIA. <i>Of Lena Geyer</i>. Scribner, 1936.
Well-known novel of the life of an opera singer. Lena
has a young satellite and adorer, but Elsie is careful to
say that while &#8220;gossip has had many cruel things to say of
this friendship ... there was, needless to say, not a word
of truth in the essential accusation.&#8221; The two women
remain together, even after Lena&#8217;s marriage, until her death.</p>

<p class="indent">DAVEY, WILLIAM. <i>Dawn Breaks the Heart</i>. Howell Soskin &amp; Co, 1941.
A lengthy episode involves the sensitive hero&#8217;s
elopement with Vivian, an irresponsible girl who turns out
to be a lesbian and leaves him for another woman. Excellent.</p>

<p class="indent">DAVIES, RHYS. &#8220;Orestes&#8221;, ss in <i>The Trip to London</i>. N. Y. Howell
Soskin &amp; Co, 1946. A lesbian manages to free the
protagonist of a mother-complex, because her attitude is
free of feminine seductiveness.</p>

<p class="indent3">+ DAVIS, FITZROY. <i>Quicksilver.</i> Harcourt, Brace, 1942.
Hilarious novel of the theatre, supposedly based on
actual personalities recognizable to the initiate; my
reviewer wrote that some theatrical people &#8220;literally turn
purple at the mere mention of this book ... most real pro
actors detest portrayal of homosexuality in theatre fiction,
bad publicity and all that ... can&#8217;t say I blame them much.&#8221;</p>

<p class="indent">DAY, MAX. <i>So Nice, So Wild.</i> pbo, Stanley Library Inc, 1959.
Evening waster; an impossibly complicated murder-story
plot with a hero who, trying to prove he didn&#8217;t murder his
own uncle, is pestered by all sorts of girls crawling into
his bunk, blondes, brunettes and a few lesbians trying hard
to convert themselves to heterosexuality. Funny, real fun.</p>

<p class="indent">DEAN, RALPH. <i>One Kind of Woman.</i> pbo, Beacon, 1959. Evening waster.</p>

<p class="indent2">These are
all hardcover risque novels retailing for about $3 in bookstores
which deal in that sort of thing for the adult trade
only; I don&#8217;t know, not being a postal inspector, whether they<span class='pagenum3'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
can legally be sent through the U S Mails. On the whole I
would think not. They are all fairly well written for books
of their kind, amusing and entertaining, and bear about the
same relationship to the paperback scv&mdash;evening wasters that
ESQUIRE does to the average cheaper girly magazine. They
are, however, strictly for a male audience; the &#8220;lesbian&#8221;
content in all of them is presented from a strip-tease point
of view and in every case the girl involved is &#8220;cured&#8221; of
this perversion by male seduction&mdash;in some cases, by brutality.
The plot of <i>Non Stop Flight</i> is typical; hero Eric
Leighton discovers his wife dallying with a lesbian, so he
beats up and rapes the lesbian (juicily described) whereupon
his wife commits suicide. Then Eric gets involved with Celia,
a stereotype &#8220;dish&#8221; with an ineffectual husband; when Celia
tires of him he beats her up and rapes her (juicily described)
then runs across the lesbian who has seduced his wife <i>and</i>
Celia, so he beats her up and rapes her again (juicily
described) after which Eric and the lesbian get married and
live very happily forever after. I don&#8217;t know precisely
what to call these books, but lesbiana is hardly descriptive.
You have been warned.</p>

<p class="indent">DEISS, JAY. <i>The Blue Chips.</i> Simon &amp; Schuster 1957, pbr Bantam
1958. fco. In an excellent novel of medical laboratory
workers, a very very minor lesbian character.</p>

<p class="indent">DE FORREST, MICHAEL. <i>The Gay Year.</i> N. Y., Woodford Press, 1949,
(m). Happily untypical of this publisher&#8217;s racy trash,
this story of a young man searching for self-knowledge in
New York&#8217;s Bohemias is very good of its&#8217; kind.</p>

<p class="indent">DELL, FLOYD. <i>Diana Stair.</i> Farrar &amp; Rinehart, 1932.
Long novel of the early 19th century. Diana is a
woman writer, but also explores life as mill-girl, school-teacher
and abolitionist. Though attracted to, and attractive
to men, she is never without &#8220;some older woman to adore and
emulate, or some younger woman to teach and inspire.&#8221;
Delightful, ironic novel of the trouble women can get into when
they refuse to fall neatly into the ruts laid down by
conventional society for women&#8217;s lives.</p>

<p class="indent">DE MEJO, OSCAR. <i>Diary of a Nun.</i> pbo Pyramid 1955.

girl in a convent warding off scandalous advances. Mediocre.</p>

<p class="indent3">+ DENNIS, NIGEL FORBES. <i>Cards of Identity.</i> Vanguard, 1955.
Hilarious novel of confused identity, dealing with
both male and female homosexuality.</p>

<p class="indent">DES CARS, GUY. <i>The Damned One.</i> pbo Pyramid, 1956.
A member of French aristocracy, ambiguously sexed

male but retains the name, dress and character
of a female to avoid scandal&mdash;which comes anyhow when <i>she</i>
carries on with an eccentric Englishwoman.</p>

depending on taste. Big handsome men of incredible stamina,
engaging incessantly in that one activity besides which all
else, is as naught, with a succession of beautiful women,
blonde, brunette and redhead. Now and then this procession
of affairs is varied a little by letting the girls sport
with one another to give the heroes a breathing spell. In
short sexy books for people who like reading sexy books.

Girls story of two loving little chums, separated by

and intense. It is highly unlikely the author was quite,
aware of the type of attachment she was portraying.</p>

Dancer Draga moves in with mannish Jo, runs into complications

The Blakiston Co, 1944-45. Sherida comes as companion-secretary
to crippled Leah, passionately adored by her whole
family including sixteen-year-old Christine. Subtly playing
on Christine&#8217;s emotions, Leah spurs her to the point
where she attempts to murder Sherida. On the surface, the
motivation is simply the love of power, but Christine&#8217;s
emotions are clearly variant; when the book was filmed, they
carefully cast Christine as a girl of eleven, to make it
unmistakable that her adoration was only &#8220;childish.&#8221;</p>

<p class="indent3">+ HAGGARD, SIR HENRY RIDER. <i>Allan&#8217;s Wife.</i> First published, 1889;
now in print in Five Novels of H. Rider Haggard, Dover
Press, 1951. A strange story, and this year&#8217;s special &#8220;find&#8221;.
Allan, hero of the famous adventure-novelist&#8217;s KING SOLOMON&#8217;S
MINES, is here shown as a young man, in love with Stella
Carson&mdash;an English girl reared in the unspoilt beauty of
a lost valley in Darkest Africa. The romance is complicated
by the passionate jealousy of Hendrika&mdash;stolen in infancy
by gorillas, reared as a female Tarzan, and rescued to be
Stella&#8217;s companion, foster-sister and adorer. Hendrika
first attempts to murder Allan; the scene in which she rages
insanely at Allan for stealing Stella&#8217;s love, and Allan&#8217;s
quiet acceptance of the &#8220;curious&#8221; fact that the strongest
loves are not always between those of different sexes, places
this book almost alone in forthright English treatment of
variance for its date. From this high level of psychological
realism, the story reverts to Haggard-type melodrama; Stella
is kidnapped by Hendrika&#8217;s gorilla friends; dramatically
rescued in a thrilling jungle battle; her death from exposure
and Hendrika&#8217;s remorseful suicide complete the story.
Strange, romantic, and quite in a class by itself.</p>

<p class="indent3">+ HARRIS, SARA. <i>The Wayward Ones.</i> Crown 1952, pbr Signet 1956,57
One of the few really good treatments of lesbian
attachments in a girl&#8217;s reform school. Bessie, a wayward
girl, is sent to a &#8220;good&#8221; reform school; at this stage she
is naive, fairly innocent and presumably redeemable. The
loneliness, the sadistic persecution by the corrupt or
hardened matrons, and the &#8220;racket&#8221;&mdash;the enforced division
of the school into &#8220;moms&#8221; and &#8220;pops&#8221;, by hardened young girl
hooligans who like the power it gives them, and permitted by
the matrons under the self-deception that these attachments
are normal, schoolgirlish crushes&mdash;finally complete the
girl&#8217;s corruption until it is certain that she will come out
of school a confirmed young criminal, Sara Harris is herself
a social worker; this painfully accurate picture of what our
juvenile authorities contend with may, at least, give some
insight into why the police and social agencies tend to be
so violently anti-lesbian, It is hard to forget the picture
painted in this book of the frightened Bessie insisting &#8220;I
don&#8217;t never do no lovin&#8217; with girls.&#8217;&#8221;&mdash;and the threats made
to her. An absolute MUST book&mdash;on the other side.</p>

<p class="indent">HARRIS, WILLIAM HOWARD. <i>The Golden Jungle.</i> Doubleday 1957,

<p class="indent3">+ HASTINGS, MARCH. <i>Demands of the Flesh.</i> Newsstand Library pbo,
1959. Ellen, a young widow suffering from physical
frustration, goes through a period of promiscuity involving
several men and a brief affair with a lesbian, Nita. Oddly
enough for this sort of borderline-risque stuff, the lesbian
character is well and realistically drawn; realizing that
Ellen is basically normal, she helps keep her on an even keel
until she remarries. Good of kind.</p>

<p class="indent2"><i>Three Women.</i> pbo Beacon Books 1958. Good and sympathetic
story of a young girl involved with a basically decent
older woman, a lesbian, Byrne. Unfortunately Byrne is deeply
involved with, and obligated to, her Insane cousin Greta,
and the affair ends in tragedy, leaving young Paula to marry
her faithful boy friend. The lesbian interlude, however, is
treated not as a &#8220;twisted love in the shadows&#8221; or any such
cliche matter, but simply as a human relationship, in its'
total effect on Paula&#8217;s personality; and she always remembers
Byrne with affectionate regret. Excellent of kind.</p>

<p class="indent2"><i>The Obsessed.</i> Newstand Library Magenta Books, 1959.
The psychoanalysis of a nymphomaniac, including an affair
with her boy-friend&#8217;s lesbian sister. Not nearly as good as
March Hastings&#8217;other books, and much more dedicated to
sexy scenes at the expense of character and situation.
Evening waster&mdash;almost scv. (It should be noted that some
paperback publishers insist on a specified number of sex
scenes, and in such a book as this one can almost hear the
weary sigh with which the author abandons his story, which
is going well, and stops everything for another measured
dose of sexy writing for the nitwit audience.)</p>

Allegedly a novel of a woman&#8217;s prison, complete with
glossary of &#8220;prison slang&#8221;&mdash;but if the author has ever been
inside a woman&#8217;s prison, or even done any authentic research,
your editors will eat a copy of the book, complete with
cover jackets. Brief plot; butchy Rusty makes a pass at
prison newcomer Marcia, in order to share her commissary
credits. When Rusty gets out of prison she marries and goes
straight and Marcia kills herself. Read it and weep.</p>

<p class="indent">KING, MARY JACKSON. <i>The Vine of Glory.</i> Bobbs-Merrill, 1948.
This won a prize as the best novel on race relations
by a Southern writer for its year. A repressed, inhibited,
small-town girl, Lavinia, at the mercy of elderly tyrannical
relatives, forms a close friendship with a Negro man who was
her only childhood friend. The friendship between Lavinia and
Augustus is purely platonic; she attends a school he has
set up for colored girls who wish to improve themselves, and
he helps to find her a job; but enraged small-minded bigots
bring on a lynching. Early in the book a preparation is
laid for Lavinia&#8217;s lack of friends of her own sex and status
by her unfortunate friendship with Dixie Murdoch, teen-age
daughter of a Holy-roller preacher. While spending the
night, Dixie attempts to make homosexual advances to the
younger girl, and Lavinia becomes hysterical. The episode is
brief, condemnatory and very realistic.</p>

<p class="indent">KIN, DAVID GEORGE. <i>Women Without Men.</i> Brookwood, 1958.
The author calls this &#8220;True stories of lesbian life in
Greenwich Village&#8221;. It represents a roundup of a dozen or so
famous literary and artistic figures, presented as
case histories. They are presented, picture after sordid
picture, without a glimmer of understanding or real insight,
though he sometimes shows smug sympathy for a few he claims
to have reformed by something he calls &#8220;cultural therapy&#8221;.
He baldly states in the preface; &#8220;I take my mental hygiene
from Moses, rather than Freud, and have the Mosaic horror of
homosexuality&#8221;. Despite this vicious slanting, the book is
explicit, funny in places, and presumably verifiable&mdash;but
certainly makes homosexuality look like a Fate Worse Than
Death. The writing is straight from the tabloid newspapers.</p>

An unmarried woman missionary in Siam incurs criticism

risks her own life by isolating herself to nurse Angela
through typhoid, she loses her own position. Neither the
author nor the heroine of the novel admit the faintest
tinge of lesbianism to the relationship, which is full of
warmth and selfless sacrifice, and India angrily denies the
accusation when it is made; but the high emotional intensity
of the whole story bring it well within the boundaries

<p class="indent3">+ MacINNES, COLIN. <i>Absolute Beginners.</i> London, MacGibbon &amp; Rae,

purposes. She has an affair with an American correspondent
and also captivates Sophie, a countess, and an extremely
well-portrayed character. One of the most sympathetic
portraits of a lesbian in recent fiction, as well as a ruthless
portrayal of women who enjoy flirting in both fields.</p>

<p class="indent3">+ MAHYERE, EVELINE. <i>I Will not Serve.</i> Dutton 1959, 1960.
This book, boycotted by many major reviewers, was
written by a young Frenchwoman who committed suicide before
its publication. Precocious, nonconformist Sylvie has
been expelled from a convent for writing, in a letter, that
she loves one of the nuns. The story deals with the
unfolding pattern of Sylvie&#8217;s meetings with Julienne, an
older novice in the convent. The conflict is clear; Sylvie&#8217;s
creed is &#8220;I will not serve&#8221;&mdash;a statement of her refusal
to become a good wife and mother&mdash;and she wants nothing
of life but Julienne. Julienne, has given herself<span class='pagenum2'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
to God. Refusing to accept this, Sylvie commits suicide.
The book is profound and sincere, and on the basis of this
one work the author&#8217;s premature death was a loss to the
field of literature.</p>

<p class="indent">MAINE, CHARLES ERIC. <i>World Without Men.</i> pbo, Ave Books 1958.
Science fiction of a world thousands of years in the future,
where the men have all died out, reproduction is scientific
and the women, having no one else to love, love one another.
In defiance of all conceivable theories of heredity and
environment, a few women still think this state of affairs
is &#8220;unnatural&#8221; and band together to create a male birth,
assuming everyone will turn normal overnight. Silly.</p>

scenes laid in the College of Vestals are exclusively lesbian;
there are both serious, emotional affairs between
women, and funny light-hearted ones in the manner of King
Pausole. Good of kind.</p>

London, J. M. Dent &amp; Co, 1925, 1926. <i>Birth of the Gods.</i>
A fine novel of Crete and the bull-dancers (and perhaps the
first of its kind). Dio, a strangely bisexual young girl,
priestess of the Great Mother, though attracted and attractive
to men, is vowed to remain a virgin in the service of the
Goddess; much of the novel is devoted to her passionate
friendship for her young novice, Eoia. One of Dio&#8217;s rejected
lovers, believing that the &#8220;little witch&#8221; has cast a
spell on Dio to prevent her loving him, plots to have Eoia
killed in the ring; instead Eoia&#8217;s death nearly destroys

A fine, occasionally funny novel of an Anglican lay
church-community centers around Michael Meade, a man of
honor, intelligence, and integrity&mdash;and a homosexual. His
hopes of being ordained as a priest were destroyed when, as
a schoolteacher, he became entangled with young Nick; Nick&#8217;s
appearance at the community destroys Michael&#8217;s peace of
mind thoroughly, and an obliquely handled relationship
between Nick, Michael and a guileless youngster, Toby,
spending the summer at the community, eventually destroys
the community entirely. But it isn&#8217;t all gloom and doom;
the level of the writing is highly competent, sometimes
wildly hilarious, and through all his difficulties Michael
is able to realize that eventually he will &#8220;experience
again ... that infinitely extended requirement which one human
being makes on another.&#8221; A book which emphasizes the
triumph of love, and one of the recent best. ((Editor&#8217;s
note; why are the best novels of male homosexuality written
by women? Mesdames Renault and Murdoch are giving their
best to the men. Is it a question of detachment?))</p>

sort of lesbian dreamworld&mdash;these women seemed to live in
a society, and a world, completely unmixed with ordinary
life at all. Certainly they are all treated as quite the
ordinary thing, and there are almost no hints that there
is a heterosexual world outside the gay one, which must be
taken into account. Certainly it makes no incursions
into the novel. Chris, a conchologist, her life complicated
by her frigid girl-friend Dizz, suffers and drinks too
much and sleeps around until Carol, one of her random
pick-ups, decides to stick to her, and eventually frees
Chris from this attachment. Good but unreal.</p>

<p class="indent">SINCLAIR, JO. (pseud. of Ruth Seid) <i>Wasteland</i>. Harper Bros. 1946.
This is the excellent and heavily lauded Harper prize
novel of that year. Told on the psychiatrist&#8217;s couch, it
concerns the failure of Jewish Jake Braunowitz to live up to
his manhood ... which forces this job onto the shoulders of his
sister Debbie, a lesbian. The psychiatrist discovers that he
ran from his responsibilities in the first place due to
feeling weaker than the masterful intelligent Debbie; then,

<p class="indent3">+ SMITH, ARTEMIS.
<i>Odd Girl.</i> Beacon pbo, 1959.
The blurb reads &#8220;Life and love among warped women&#8221;, but
don&#8217;t let it scare you. This is one of the better and more
serious approaches to the writing of a serious novel of lesbians
through the stereotyped pattern of the paperback novel.
The basic plot concerns Anne, and her experiences in trying
to find out for herself, the hard way, whether she is a lesbian
or whether she can successfully adjust to life as a normal
woman. The story ends with the surprising, but growingly
popular affirmation that &#8220;adjustment&#8221; is not always to be
desired at all costs. The cover also calls this a story of
&#8220;society&#8217;s greatest curse&#8221;; meaning homosexuality; but for
once it isn&#8217;t treated that way.</p>

with men. Slightly more sensational than &#8220;Odd Girl&#8221;, but
well written, well thought out and generally excellent.</p>

anyhow. Gold Medal&#8217;s most popular title so far is the story
of a group of women with the Free French women&#8217;s army, at
loose ends and disassociated from family, friends and personal

the least mature, is as yet infatuated only with Mother
Nathalie, her teacher; no overt behavior is implied except
kisses, but the nun&#8217;s reaction when the heroine begins to be
interested in boys brings this under the scope of the study.</p>

Evening waster about a young no-good who earns his living as

loudly insists he is normal. Your editor enjoyed this out of
sheer perversity; usually novels treating of male homosexuality
engage the subject with deadly seriousness, while the
paperback originals reek with drooling voyeuristic strip-teases
about lesbians, for the sake of men who like to enjoy
pipe-dreams about lesbians making love, and about some Big
Handsome Hero who eventually converts the girls to &#8220;normality&#8221;
with some secret formula of caresses. So it is a nice change
to see the gay BOYS getting the in-and-out-of-the-sheets
treatment for once.</p>

<p class="indent">WYLIE, PHILIP. <i>The Disappearance.</i> Rinehart 1951, pbr Pocket
Books 1958. Science fiction; for men, all women
vanish; for women, all men vanish. The problem of lesbianism
arises in the women&#8217;s world; Wylie, though technically and
superficially approving of homosexuality, has his heroine
reject it for herself, saying &#8220;I&#8217;m not a child.&#8221;</p>

<p class="indent2"><i>Opus 21.</i> Rinehart 1949, pbr Signet 1952, 1960.
The hero, rewriting a book in a hotel during a weekend of
crisus, runs across many unusual characters; among them a
woman, shaken because her husband is having a homosexual
affair, is shamed into tolerance by dallying with a lesbian
prostitute. Wylie, again superficially approving, has his
hero act in a skirt-withdrawing way, refusing such things

New Directions, 1947, $2.50, still in print.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Shakespeare, William</i>&mdash;The first 27 of the &#8220;Sonnets&#8221; are generally
adjudged to be male-homosexual in emphasis and are therefore
of interest to collectors in this field.</p>

<p><br />THE ROMANTIC POETS&mdash;19th CENTURY:</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Coleridge, Samuel T.</i>&mdash;Christabel. Long narrative poem of a

English literature.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Romani, Felice</i>&mdash;Norma. Italian libretto for the opera by Vincenzo
Bellini, generally adjudged to be subtly lesbian in overtones.

<p class="indent"><i>Swinburne, Algernon Charles</i>&mdash;Poems and Ballads, 2 vols, London,
Chatto &amp; Windus, 1893, 1895. Many of the poems in this series

space limitation, only the major titles will be listed for
those who want to sift through anthologies; Anactoria,
Fragoletta, Sapphics, At Eleusis, Sonnet with a copy of
Mlle. de Maupin, The Masque of Queen Bersabe, Erotion. The
entire series of Poems and Ballads is available in her no. 961,
Everyman&#8217;s Library, Dutton, 1940, 50, for $1.95.</p>

most easily located probably being the Liveright &#8220;Collected
works of Pierre Louys&#8221;, $3.50. There is also a paperback
edition, Avon Red and Gold Library, no date. The &#8220;Songs&#8221;
have been published singly in numerous privately printed
and illustrated editions, some of which are very beautiful
collector&#8217;s items.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Bront&euml;, Emily</i>&mdash;Complete Poems. N. Y. Columbia University Press,
1941 (still in print at $4.00). A scattering of these poems
are (or can be interpreted as) vaguely variant.</p>

(Rare, and expensive.)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Field, Michael</i>&mdash;(pseud. of two Englishwomen.) Entire work of
lesbian interest and a &#8220;must&#8221; for completists. Most medium

variant poems are scattered throughout her earlier editions.
(Selected Poems, Modern Library, 1948, $1.65.)</p>

<p><br />THE MODERN POETS:</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lowell, Amy</i>&mdash;No one volume of her work can be singled out; her
poems are perhaps the most openly variant of any of the English
or American poets. Her &#8220;Complete Poetical Works&#8221; is still in
print; Boston, Houghton &amp; Mifflin Co., 1955; Introduction by
Louis Untermeyer, $6.00.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>O&#8217;Neill, Rose</i>&mdash;The Master Mistress. N. Y. Knopf, 1922. The
creator of the &#8220;Kewpies&#8221; also was the writer of these sensitive,
occasionally erotic poems. Perhaps a dozen are explicitly
lesbian.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Hall, Radclyffe</i>&mdash;Poems of the Past and Present, London, Chapman
&amp; Hall, 1910. Songs of Three Counties, Chapman &amp; Hall, 1913.
The Forgotten Island, London, Chapman &amp; Hall, 1915.
Sheaf of Verses, London, Chapman &amp; Hall, 1905.
Twixt Earth and Stars, London, Chapman &amp; Hall, 1906.</p>

<p class="indent2">These poems
by the author of &#8220;Well of Loneliness&#8221; are so overt that it is
almost unbelievable that they were printed at all, but they
were, and I have the books to prove it ... she managed to get
away with it, I guess, because she talks in these poems as
if she were a man, writing to a woman.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Millay, Edna St. Vincent</i>&mdash;Collected Poems, N. Y. Harper, 1956,
$6.00. This is the favored anthology of Millay for this
purpose, since it contains everything of hers which is variant
in tone. However, there are many single volumes of her poetry
available, and also pbrs; Collected Lyrics (Washington Square,
50&cent;), and Collected Sonnets (Washington Square, 50&cent;).</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sackville-West, Victoria</i>&mdash;King&#8217;s Daughter, N. Y. Doubleday, 1930.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sterling, George</i>&mdash;Strange Waters. Privately printed, n.d., also
in American Esoterica, N. Y. Macy-Masius, 1927. Lengthy narrative
poem of supposed incestuous lesbianism ... shocker.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Doolittle, Hilda (H.D.)</i>&mdash;Red Roses for Bronze, London, Lord,
Chatto &amp; Windus. Also the Grove Press qpb, Selected Poems of
H.D., 1957; this, however, does not contain the best-known of
Sappho paraphrases, &#8220;Fragment Thirty-six&#8221;. Also &#8220;Collected
Poems&#8221;, Liveright, $2.50.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Pitter, Ruth</i>&mdash;English poetess, whose work is rather difficult to
locate in this country. Many of her early poems are tinged
with variance and well worth the effort of locating them in
large libraries.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Smith, Alicia Kay</i>&mdash;Only in Whispers. Privately printed; Falmouth,
Rockport, Maine. This is the hardest book on this list to
obtain, and of course, the most overt. Ardently but in good
taste, this tells of a lengthy and beautiful lesbian affair.
A &#8220;must&#8221; book for serious collectors who like poetry.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Wright, James</i>&mdash;The Green Wall. Yale University Press, 1957, $3.00.
Two overt poems in an excellent and sensitive collection.</p>

<h2>variant films</h2>

<h4>compiled by LauraJean Ermayne and Gene Damon</h4>

<p>With the exception of a few privately filmed and circulated stag films, which of
course do not come within the scope of this study, lesbianism is treated only
vaguely and by indirection in motion pictures. Hollywood codes (which regulate
distribution even of foreign films in this country) state unequivocally that
homosexuality may not be portrayed <i>or suggested</i>. (Italixs mine). Even when the
predominantly homosexual novel COMPULSION was filmed, the script&mdash;though including
a rape scene&mdash;was fudged so that the relationship between the two boys was
never hinted at&mdash;except vaguely in one scene, where Orson Welles as the great
lawyer said that the opposition might find &#8220;something fishy&#8221; in the fact that
they had no other friends. Your editor has since been informed that the movie
NEVER SO FEW portrayed recognizable homosexuals. Hollywood codes are growing
less stringent by the day, with the general relaxation of censorship, and by
next year there should be some additions to this list. Thanks are due to Miss
Ermayne for allowing us to reprint the material used in her article on The
Sapphic Cinema in THE LADDER for March, 1959 ... the Editors.</p>

<p>THE ADVENTURES OF KING PAUSOLE. Filmed in France in 1932, with Emil Jannings.
Based on the Pierre Louys novel, this starred 366 models and dancers from the
Folies bergeres; among these near-nude and nubile nymphs was one disguised as a
male ballet dancer, with whom the King&#8217;s daughter Aline had a romance even
after discovering that they were of the same sex.</p>

<p>ALL ABOUT EVE took the Academy Award in 1950. There is a very lesbian situation
used to introduce the main protagonist into the movie; later events proved the
woman only pretending lesbian-type devotion, but the inference, in the
beginning, is clear and unmistakable. (GD)</p>

<p>THE BARKER 1928. A short silent picture which was banned in many cities because
it featured a scene in which a very butchy type in men&#8217;s pajamas got into bed
with a fluffy blonde type; caused a lot of critical hoop-la. (GD)</p>

<p>THE CHILDREN&#8217;S HOUR, a film based on the Lillian Hellman play reviewed in this
Checklist, bears a question mark; will someone who has seen the picture please
let us know whether lesbian content was implicit in the movie?</p>

<p>CHILDREN OF LONELINESS, outright anti-homophile propaganda, was mostly male-oriented,
but did contain a gay night-club scene, and picture and office butch
whose offer of affection and protection drove one girl to a psychiatrist&#8217;s
couch&mdash;where she was counselled against &#8220;abnormal love&#8221;.</p>

<p>DARK VICTORY. 1939, recently shown on TV, concerns a talented, charming woman
(Bette Davis) dying of a brain tumor; her constant companion and secretary is
clearly in love with her, and there were numerous beautiful and heartbreaking
scenes, some of which would be impossible in a movie not dealing with such a
sad situation.</p>

<p>CLUB DES FEMMES (Girl&#8217;s Club in English) an admirable French film starring
Danielle Darieux, reviewed at length in THE LADDER. The lesbian element is
treated explicitly and with taste and charm.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<p>ESCAPE TO YESTERDAY, a French film with one brief sequence in a cabaret, where
recognizably lesbian types were portrayed.</p>

<p>MAEDCHEN IN UNIFORM, a classic German film of the thirties, reviewed at length
in J H Foster&#8217;s book, starring Hertha Thiele as Manusia and Dorothea Wieck as
her teacher. The film has recently been re-made but has not yet reached the USA.</p>

<p>THE GODDESS, an art film released about a year ago, starring Kim Stanley, shows
the life of an unwanted child who grows up to be a movie queen and ends up living
with her secretary, obviously a lesbian; the relationship is portrayed with
unusual frankness. This movie is still playing in specialty theatres around
the big cities.</p>

<p>NO EXIT, a French film of the play by Jean-Paul Sartre; setting, limbo; one of the
characters, a lesbian who fell in love with a married woman and drove her to
suicide by spooking her.</p>

<p>OPEN CITY, realistic Italian film of 10 years or so ago, had a recognizable
lesbian type-cast in it.</p>

<p>PIT OF LONELINESS, a French film based on the novel OLIVIA and starring Simone
Simon. &#8220;Something of a disappointment&#8221; says LJE.</p>

<p>QUEEN CHRISTINA, 1934. This famous screen classic starred Greta Garbo; the
variant bits were minor, but they were there. (GD)</p>

<p>ROSE OF WASHINGTON SQUARE 1939. Now-dated tear-jerker starring Alice Faye; in
one long scene the heroine sings standing by a piano, while a clearly seen, very
mannish and extremely obvious &#8220;type&#8221; drools over her. Not imagination; this
one was the veddy veddy correct, monocled type. (GD)</p>

<p>SIGN OF THE RAM, a filming circa 1947 of the Margaret Ferguson novel, starred
Susan Peters as the wheelchaired heroine; the &#8220;crush&#8221; between Leah and Christine
was treated vaguely but recognizably to anyone who had read the book.</p>

<p>TIME OF DESIRE. &#8220;Much has been made of the Uranian aspect of this film but
personally I couldn&#8217;t see it....&#8221; LJE</p>

<p>TORST (&#8220;Thirst&#8221;) directed by Ingmar Bergman, is supposed to tell the lives of
three women strangely in love, including a lesbian. As yet none of your
editors or contributors have seen the film.</p>

<p>TURNABOUT, the Thorne Smith sex-farce where a man&#8217;s ego is transmuted into a
woman&#8217;s body.</p>

<p>TITLE UNKNOWN; 1950 or 1951; French with English subtitles; action took place in
a girl&#8217;s reformatory, much reference to lesbianism and some overt scenes; one
where a girl caressed the breast of another and whispered love words to her,
another where a tough street type tells a young innocent &#8220;See these marks on my
thighs, they are each the marks of a lover, the left leg for boys and the right
for girls.&#8221; I don&#8217;t see any other way to interpret that scene. (GD)</p>

<p>Every year, following the publication of the Checklist, we receive a number of
queries. Where, they want to know, can we buy these books? We can only tell
you where we buy books; and have therefore assembled the following list of
reputable dealers, mail order, who handle these books and many others.</p>

<p class="indent">WINSTON BOOK SERVICE, 250 Fulton Avenue; Hempstead, New York.
Successor to the famous Cory Book Service which was founded by Donald
Webster Cory, author of &#8220;The Homosexual in America&#8221;. This is perhaps
the best American source for current novels in hard covers and non-fiction.
They issue catalogs and lists, give a sizable discount for
large orders, and will also locate hard-to-find or out-of-print books.
Leslie Laird Winston, who is the presiding genius here, is one of
the nicest people to deal with that we have ever known. Every month
they feature some new or special book in the field, at a special price.
Getting on their mailing list is the <i>best</i> thing that can happen to a
collector.</p>

<p class="indent">DORIAN BOOK SERVICE, 693 Mission Street, San Francisco 5, California.
A subsidiary of the Mattachine Review and the Pan-Graphic Press. They
publish the Dorian Book Quarterly, dealt with elsewhere, and also a fat,
fascinating catalogue listing several hundred titles of current hard-cover
and paperback fiction. They can also furnish, or will locate, many
out-of-print titles. My experience with them; prompt service, fast
shipment, up-to-date information on cheap reprints of rare titles.</p>

<p class="indent">VILLAGE BOOKS AND PRESS, 114-116 Christopher Street, New York 14, New York.
This is the outfit behind the Noel Garde bibliography of Homosexual
Literature, mentioned in the editorial. They can still supply this
biblio list for $1.50. They also issue lists at frequent intervals, and
will search for hard-to-find and out-of-print titles. Prices seem
reasonable considering the scarcity of some of the paperbacks he handles.
The proprietor, Howard Frisch, is one of the most co-operative dealers in
the business.</p>

<p class="indent">ONE Magazine, listed in &#8220;Related Publications&#8221; has published one volume of
short stories, and is soon to do more publishing; they also list several
dozen books sold by mail order.</p>

<p class="indent">THE LADDER, listed in &#8220;Related Publications&#8221;, is soon to set up a book service;
their first special release will be Jeannette Howard Foster&#8217;s &#8220;Sex
Variant Women in Literature&#8221;, so keep your eyes open.</p>

<p class="indent">THE TENTH MUSE, bookshop managed by Julia Newman, 326 West 15th St, New York 11,
New York, also does some mail order business. Write for a list.</p>

<p class="indent">A POINTS NORTHE, unusual bookshop at 15 Robinson Street, in Oklahoma City,
managed by James Neill Northe, into which your senior editor virtually
stumbled during a rainstorm, specializes in very rare, esoteric and<span class='pagenum2'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
scholarly titles, curiosa, etc. He can supply even the most fantastically
rare stuff; prices are in line with the rarity of the items wanted. (It
was Mr. Northe who, with disinterested kindness, supplied some biblio data
on the real rarities on the list; he has our thanks and endorsement.)</p>

<p class="indent">BOOKPOST, C. Rogers, Box 3251, San Diego 3, California. This outfit specializes
in Americana, but can supply almost anything. The prices here are the most
reasonable I&#8217;ve ever encountered; if Rogers quotes you a price, there&#8217;s no
point in shopping around for a lower one.</p>

<p class="indent">INTERNATIONAL BOOKFINDERS, P O Box 3003, Beverly Hills, California. These
people are the out-of-print bookfinders par excellence. I&#8217;ve ordered many
books from them; their prices are reasonable, never exorbitant; their
service is good, the books they supply are always of high quality. They&#8217;re
nice to deal with. I&#8217;ve never had a complaint in ten years of bookhunting.</p>

<p class="indent">RAYMOND TRANFIELD, Antiquarian Book Dealer, 31 Hart Street, Henley-Upon-Thames,
Oxon, England, is probably the best source for older books published in
England. His prices are reasonable, his service is fast (he quotes by
airmail and sends his parcels insured, which is a blessing for anything
which has to travel across the ocean).</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Introducing the editors and contributors....</p></div>

<p class="indent">MARION ZIMMER BRADLEY, Editor and publisher of the Checklist,
who attends to such minor chores as editorial format and
manhandling the mimeograph, is by profession a writer of
science fiction. Her work has appeared in virtually
every science fiction magazine on the market. She is
thirty years-old, lives in a small town in Texas, and her
other interests are Italian opera, acrobatics and
mountain climbing.</p>

<p class="indent">GENE DAMON, whose competent brain does the bibliographical
work for the Checklist, is in her mid-twenties, lives
in the midwest, and is a librarian; she previously worked
as a book-keeper and on a large city newspaper. Her
chief interests are classical music and the collecting
of variant literature; her private library contains over
600 titles of lesbiana alone. It was the untiring, perfectionist
efforts of Miss Damon which checked every biblio
reference in this list; she also supplied a summary or
precis for every title which the senior editor had not
read. In general, Damon is the brains of the Checklist;
MZB merely the brawn.</p>

<p class="indent">KERRY DAME, stencil-cutter, artist and printer&#8217;s devil, is in
her early twenties and lives in New England with her
mother and many cats. She is no stranger to the readers
of the <i>Ladder</i>, who all know her gay, airy cover drawings.</p>

<p class="indent">LAURAJEAN ERMAYNE, contributor to <i>Vice Versa</i>, collector of
lesbiana, specialist in films, and tireless hunter of the
news-stands, lives in California and, under her own name,
is a well-known editor and writer.</p>

has just discovered a stack of copies of the ASTRA&#8217;S TOWER
Checklist #3. We thought they&#8217;d all been destroyed. This is
the last-year&#8217;s list, containing Royal Drummond&#8217;s &#8220;Digression&#8221;,
and my account of a hassle with the fascinatin' Miss Apple. I
want to get these things out of my broom closet, and my soul
revolts at the thought of tossing the things into the trash
burner for the edification of the garbage collector. Therefore,
we will make the following offer. Mailing these things
out by printed-matter, fourth class mail costs 7-1/2 cents. By
first class mail, 12 cents postage is required. Envelopes cost
something. If anyone wants these (who knows, they might be
valuable as examples of prehistoric lesbiana some day) you
can have then for a quarter (first class mail) or six for a
dollar to pass around among your friends. Hurry up&mdash;I&#8217;m going
to need my broom closet for the mimeograph when I get finished
with this year&#8217;s Checklist. You&#8217;ll find the address on the

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
